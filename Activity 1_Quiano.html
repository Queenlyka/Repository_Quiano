       <h1> Adventures in Code-Fu </h1> <br>
       <h2> My HTML Journey from <mark> Chaos </mark> to <mark> Cat Videos </mark> </h2> <br>
       <h3> Or, how I accidentally created a self-playing cat videos website (and almost lost my sanity) </h3> <br>
       <p> Armed with boundless <em> enthusiasm </em> and <em> zero coding experience, </em> I embarked on my Quest to Conquer <mark> HTML .</mark> </p> <small> Little </small> did I know my journey would be less <b> "Lord of the Rings" </b> and more <b> "Three Stooges." </b> <br>
       <p> My <ins> first Website </ins> lovingly named <bold> "Brenda's Blossoming Boutique",</bold> resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock </mark> painting. </p>
       <h4> Tags were <del> scattered </del> like <em> colors clashed </em> like a sunset on <mark> Mars </mark> and the navigation system could only be described as <b> "whimsical" </b> </h4> <subs> (by a very generous browser.) </subs> <br>
       <h4> Determined to redeem myself, I tackled a <b> "simple" </b> project: <mark> a cat video gallery. </mark> When ensued was a <i> hilarious </i> <sup>(and slightly terrifying)</sup> <ins> ballet misplaced semicolons, rogue line breaks, </ins> and <ins> images </ins> that danced uncontrollably <del> across </del> the screen. At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow, </i> much to the amusement <subs> (and slight concern) </subs> of my family. </h4> <br>
       <h4> After <ins> several meldowns, countless tutorials, </ins> and <ins> gallons of coffee.</ins> I finally manage to wrangle my code into <i> submission.</i> </h4>
       <h4> My cat video gallery wasn't exactly <b> "elegant", </b> but it functioned <sup> (mostly) </sup> And hey, i learned that even the <b> clumsiest coder </b> can create something... <i> interesting. </i> So, here's to <mark> Brenda's Blossoming Boutique, <i> the self-playing cat videos extravaganza, </i></mark> and the <del> never-ending </del> quest to master the art of <b> HTML! </b></h4> <br>
